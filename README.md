# Gradient descent algorithm 

In this project, I implemented a gradient descent algorithm for a perceptron that can learn the AND-NOT function and plot the final classification result with error function changes.

Once again, repeated the algorithm for the data presented in the [attached file](01_heights_weights_genders.csv).



## Language 
This project is written in python language and numpy module.

Python loops (for, while) are not used.
